      <text><![CDATA[
        ProjectLK is the continuation of LKO - Lernkartei Online.<br>
        The Idea is to convert the Principle of Flashcards (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">according to Sebastion Leitner</a>) to a web application.
        ProjectLK is based on PHP and Javascript and uses MySQL for the Database.
        The only cost for the Project are those for the webserver. Everything else is free (as in freedom), so the whole Project is open source.
