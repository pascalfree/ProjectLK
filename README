About ProjectLK
===============
ProjectLK is a web based open source application for managing digital text based flash cards with the focus on vocabulary.
It's designed after the Leitner System [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_System], but it also offers the possibility to review the cards in any way you want.
Additionally verbs can be listed in tables of conjugations and also be reviewed.
It uses MySQL, PHP and Javascript.

Release & Developer Version
===========================
There are 2 versions of this code. The first version, the developer version, provides all code and files in a readable and uncompressed format. In the release version the javascript part of the code is compressed with the closure compiler and unused .xcf image files are removed. Also the javascript compiler is removed. 
Both versions can be installed in the same way as described in INSTALL.txt.
In order to convert a developer version into a release version these steps must be followed:

1. copy everything into a seperate folder
2. inside that folder compile javascript by using the make command in the terminal.
3. delete the folder "compiler"
4. delete all uncompiled javascript files
5. delete all .xcf image files
6. inside config.php set release = 1 and debug = 0.
A more detailed description can be found in the wiki
