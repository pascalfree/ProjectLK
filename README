About ProjectLK
===============
ProjectLK is a web based open source application for managing digital text based flash cards with the focus on vocabulary.
It's designed after the Leitner System [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leitner_System], but it also offers the possibility to review the cards in any way you want.
Additionally verbs can be listed in tables of conjugations and also be reviewed.
It uses MySQL, PHP and Javascript.
